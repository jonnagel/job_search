# INTRO

**Warning** : this is a work in progress 


I'm reviving a side project from the past. The goal is to efficiently and
deterministically match opportunities with with my personality via similarity 
matching methods. 

Datasets:
1. web job search APIs (more info to be added)
1. personal email, personality tests, etc

# USAGE
```
from src.SearchBIC import SearchBIC
from src.tftext import TFText
searches = ['data science', 'python', 'decision science', 'data analyst']
bic = SearchBIC(searches)
bic.update()
```
